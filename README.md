# Credit Risk & Loan Performance Analysis

A data-driven project to identify borrower segments with higher default risk and uncover profitable lending strategies using SQL and Excel.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project analyzes over **38,000 loan records** to extract insights into credit risk, default patterns, and lending performance. The analysis focuses on key borrower attributes like income, loan term, credit grade, and employment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify high-risk borrower segments based on default rate
- Evaluate profitability by analyzing interest earned
- Recommend data-backed strategies to reduce risk and improve returns

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data formatting, cleaning, and charting
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data querying and analysis
- *(Power BI was not used in this project)*

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Exploration**: Reviewed 38,573 rows and 26 columns of loan data
2. **Cleaning**: Handled nulls, standardized column values, renamed fields for SQL
3. **Import**: Loaded cleaned data into MySQL for analysis
4. **Analysis**: Wrote SQL queries to evaluate borrower risk and loan performance
5. **Visualization**: Built charts in Excel to support key insights

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Default rates increase from Grade A (5.7%) to Grade G (31.3%)**
- **60-month loans are 3× riskier than 36-month loans**, but earn more interest
- **Low-income borrowers** have a higher chance of default (17.4%)
- **Interest rates rise with credit risk**, but **DTI remains stable**
- **Employment length** is not a strong predictor of risk

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Apply **stricter screening** for Grades E, F, G and low-income groups
- Use **risk-based pricing** for long-term loans
- Prioritize **low-risk, high-return** segments using credit grade & term filters
